# Concept

Hooray! I'm ready to show you my concepts for the new Cherry Roll game. This will be a multiplayer game to compete with friends. Well, like Amogus or Mario Party or Plate Up, but with a completely different setting

It is planned to create several mini-games, but there is one main - cook a cherry roll! We'll see in future how much of my plans I will do eventually

### Cooking buns will be divided into several stages. And so, here they are:

1. Pour the ingredients. You need to take a bucket, fill it with water or flour and prepare the dough in the middle of the room in the right proportions. If you make a mistake with the proportions, you will have to make the dough again, which will take your time and give odds to the opposing team.

2. Knead the dough. A spoon appears from the air (or from somewhere) and you need to spin it as fast as possible. Like this: run as fast as you possibly can and smash into a spoon!

3. Collect cherries. You go to the bun and pull the dough out of it, and cherries spawn across the map. With an elongated dough, you need to collect all the cherries and twist into a roll.

4. Take the bun to the oven and light it.

5. Control the fire. Carefully! You need to press the furs on the sides of the furnace to fan the fire. If this is done slowly, then the roll will be baked for a long time, and if it is done quickly, it will burn. The stage of roasting can be determined only if you open the oven and go inside to look. But at this time you do not fan the fire, so the bun is not baking!

6. Take the roll out of the oven. There is fire everywhere, and all the players are pulling the roll in different directions, you have to be careful

7. Serving. Each piece of roll is cut off and a plate with it is placed on the head. It is necessary, balancing with all this dessert, to bring it to the table and not to drop it

The game is going to be great, but I have to warn you. Concepts are not how the game will look like in the end. Many mechanics from the original ideas will be changed or completely removed. I hope I can add at least 50% of what I came up with, and even if so, it already will be amazing! Also, the game will be updating in the future. Therefore, in the future there will be new mini-games, maybe even those that I did not have time to add
